    "section": "Danish stops",
    "text": "Danish stops\nI’ve been fascinated with these sounds since I was first exposed to phonetics, and they remain my greatest research love. I wrote my dissertation about Danish stops, and by now I’ve investigated them from many different angles.\nMy colleagues Camilla Søballe Horslund, Henrik Jørgensen, and I published a paper in Laboratory Phonology about intervocalic stop voicing patterns in Danish based on a corpus of spontaneous speech. The results show that voicing is suppressed intervocalically in both the unaspirated stops /b d g/ and the aspirated stops /p t k/ in almost all contexts, and that when voicing does occur, it patterns with other lenition phenomena. We compare these results to the predictions of different phonological theories of laryngeal contrast, and suggest that the results are most in line with Articulatory Phonology.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard-Rode et al. 2022\n\n\nIn a paper out in Journal of Phonetics, I looked into the spectral characteristics of aspirated stop releases using the same spontaneous speech corpus. I confirmed that /t/ invariably has an affricated release (which is generally taken for granted in the literature), but also that affrication typically does not last throughout the release and that it gradually gives way to aspiration throughout the release, probably suggesting that it is not an affricate in the sense of e.g. Stevens (1993). /k/ releases are often affricated to varying degrees and in ways that are highly affected by the coarticulary context, while /p/ releases are usually dominated by aspiration in most contexts. I argue that, in spite of their differences, the stops likely behave as a class from an articulatory perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard-Rode 2022\n\n\nI’ll cover all of this further below, but my interest in this topic has also led me to look at regional variation in how the stops are realized and how they have changed over time in traditional dialects of Jutland; colleagues and I have looked into the synchronic and diachronic phonology of so-called stop gradation, i.e. the somewhat notorious alternations between stops and semivowels in Danish; other colleagues and I have proposed underlying representations of the Danish stops couched in a representational framework we call Q-CV; I’ve looked into how the realization of coronal stops in Danish affect the Mandarin Chinese affricates produced by Danish L2 learners; and I’ve explored how the bandpass filters of landline telephones and other telephone connections affect speaker-specific acoustic properties of stop releases.\nMany open questions remain when it comes to Danish stops, and I’m certainly not done with them. One question that I’m actively pursuing in collaboration with James Kirby and Nicolai Pharao is the extent to which their particular laryngeal constellation affect the F0 of surrounding vowels, and whether this is affected by higher-level prosodic structure. I am also currently collaborating with Francesco Burroni on the the relative timing of articulatory gestures in stop–vowel sequences in Danish."

So I’ve adopted different methods from functional data analysis to analyze patterns of variation in spectral shape.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard-Rode 2022\n\n\nIn a paper in Journal of Phonetics, I use function-on-scalar regression models (an extension of generalized additive models) to analyze how spectral shape changes over time in stop releases, which allows for simply using spectral shape as a dependent variable in a statistical model.\nIn another paper published in the ICPhS proceedings, I use functional principal component analysis to determine the main sources of variance in spectral shape in stop releases. There are more details in Chapter 6 of my dissertation. This is something I really want to explore further but haven’t yet – I have several ideas about how to compare how spectral moments, DCT coefficients, and functional PCA categorizes spectral shape.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard-Rode 2023"

    "section": "Danish consonant gradation",
    "text": "Danish consonant gradation\nConsonant gradation is a notorious phonological pattern and/or historical development in Danish whereby consonants developed radically different realizations in strong and weak prosodic positions. This e.g. results in the voiceless unaspirated velar stop [k] alternating with the semivowels [ɪ̯] and [ʊ̯]. This has traditionally been assumed to be a synchronically active phonological pattern, where in this case the semivowels are derived from underlying stops through a series of abstract rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorslund et al. 2022\n\n\nMy colleagues Camilla Søballe Horslund Marqvorsen, Henrik Jørgensen, and I published a paper in Acta Linguistica Hafniensia arguing that this analysis is excessively abstract and cannot be learned by children from the input available to them, and instead we propose a simpler reorganization of the Danish phonemes. In a forthcoming paper, we give a diachronic account of consonant gradation, seeking to explain how the alternations came about within the framework of Evolutionary Phonology; this builds on Chapter 3 of my dissertation. Another ongoing project is to discuss our analysis in the light of early analyses in the structuralist glossematic framework from the early 20th century. We have presented this, but have yet to write anything up.\nIn another forthcoming paper, I explore the variable outcomes of consonant gradation in the traditional dialects spoken in Jutland, and how these outcomes relate to variability in the fine phonetic detail of stop realization. I have presented this research on different occasions."

We were (and they still are) building towards writing a grammar of Danish as used in conversation that relies on both usage-based linguistics, interactional linguistics, and conversation analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtalegrammatik.dk\n\n\nMy first foray into research at all was when Tina Mølgaard and I wrote about the prosody of the discourse particle nå (similar to ‘oh’ in English), and how the interactional function of nå is determined on the basis of its prosody by listeners. Later, during my MA studies, I wrote about copula reduction and deletion and how to interpret the phenomenon within the theoretical framework of Semiotic Grammar.\nMy most extensive contribution was probably my Master’s thesis which was later published in shortened form in Nordic Journal of Linguistics, which was a corpus study of the use of the prefield (forfelt) in conversational speech. Danish is a verb-second language, meaning that the second phrase in sentences is the finite verb, but the first phrase (the prefield) can be any other constituent. I showed that the prefield is remarkably inflexible – more than 50% of sentences start with det ‘it, that’, så ‘then’, or jeg ‘I’. It appears that speakers are using this to their advantage, such that speakers will start sentences with det before having determined the basic structure of the sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard 2019"

This prefix then debonded and came to be used as a free-standing adjective with the same meaning as the prefix.

Given that Danish has a saliently affricated alveolar stop [tʰ] and Mandarin has a three-way distinction between an aspirated stop [tʰ], a plain affricate [ts] and an aspirated affricate [tsʰ], this poses a particular challenge for Danish learners."

I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronunced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Spoken Language Processing group led by James Kirby at the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University, where I’m working on a variety of topics, including microprosodic cues to obstruent voicing contrasts, microprosodic cues to laryngeal coda consonants, the articulatory dynamics of Danish consonants, and the development of software tools for processing and visualizing acoustic data.\nMost of my work (including my dissertation) has dealt with the stop consonants of Danish. Colleagues and I have investigated intervocalic voicing and spectral characteristics of stop releases, and used a large legacy corpus of dialect recordings to investigate regional variation in voice onset time, closure voicing, and characteristics of stop releases. We have also proposed a new phonological analysis of the infamous Danish stop-semivowel alternations, suggesting that they are better understood as the outcome of sound change rather than synchronically active phonology.\nI have also published on information structure from an interactional linguistics perspective, forensic phonetics, second language acquisition, and morphological change.\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nMy R package praatpicture is now on CRAN and can be installed in R with the usual install.packages('praatpicture') command! This package uses base R functionality to make flexible plots and animations of speech audio, derived signals, and annotations. The package comes with extensive documentation and the README file provides example code and plots for most of the functionality. The freshest updates will still be available on GitHub before on CRAN, but I’m hoping that this can help spread the word further.\nI just got a back from a great week in Stockholm, where I first went to Phonology in the Nordic Countries where I presented me and Francesco Burroni‘s ongoing work on articulation of the Danish so-called ’soft d’. Slides can be found here. I also co-presented a poster with Maryann Tan on voicing rates and consonant-intrinsic F0 in Central Standard Swedish. Afterwards I stuck around the Multilingualism Lab and hung around with the great folks there for a few very productive days of working on said study about Central Standard Swedish. Thanks for having me!\nI’m headed to to the 13th International Seminar on Speech Production in Autrans in May to further spread the word about praatpicture, my R package for plotting acoustic data with time-aligned annotations. You can find an abstract here. Hope to see you there!\nMenghui Shi and I are hosting a special session on segmental influences on prosody at Speech Prosody in Leiden next summer. If you have any work on this, consider sending an abstract and a paper!\nI had a great trip to the UK in spite of a disastrous beginning to the journey (which was Lufthansa’s fault, not the UK’s!). Saw some very interesting talks at the Edinburgh Symposium on Historical Phonology, and Henrik and I had some great conversations about our poster. I had a wonderful trip to Lancaster afterwards, spending a few days with the extremely hospitable people from the Phonetics Lab. I presented some of my work on phonetics–phonology interfacing in Jutland Danish stop gradation (slides are here), and gave a demo of my R package praatpicture."

    "text": "Tools for processing and visualizing acoustic data\nI like to build different tools in the R environment that can ease or automate aspects of acoustic analysis and visualization.\nThe most ambitious of these is an R package called getVOT which seeks to partially automate the process of annotating landmarks for measuring voice onset time (both positive and negative). In this tutorial, I explain how to use it and how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard-Rode 2023\n\n\nI developed another R package for making nice Praat-style plots combining waveforms, spectrograms, annotations, and other derived acoustic measures. This tool has gradually grown in scope, and now also has functionality for annotating small snippets of sound within R, embedding sound in Praat-style plots, and making animations. A forthcoming paper presents the package in more detail.\nI have also built the R package phonfeatures which automatically adds columns with phonetic/phonological features to a data frame with phonetic transcriptions. I am continuously working on the package emuhelpeR which provides various convenience functions for working with the phonetic database system EMU-SDMS, particularly integrating it with the voice quality processing scripts in PraatSauce.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard-Rode 2024\n\n\nI’m working with Jonathan Harrington and Johanna Cronenberg on turning previous course notes and teaching materials on the EMU-SDMS into an online book-length tutorial. Chapters are being published here as they become available.\nFor a forthcoming paper written with Kathleen Jepson and John Mansfield, I developed a tool in R to automatically identify instances of sustained stylized prosody in corpora of Australian aboriginal narratives.\nI’ve been working on a general pipeline for quickly processing acoustic data in R (calling scripts to do forced alignment, measuring VOT, getting voice quality measures, creating an EMU database). I have a lot of convenience functions in various scattered around various public data analysis scripts for e.g. generating multitaper spectra in bulk and visualizing functional PCA, spatial generalized additive models, and growth curve analysis outputs. I’ve written a tutorial on generating multitaper spectra in R which might be published on Linguistics Methods Hub at some point.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuggaard-Rode 2023"
