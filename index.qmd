:::{#about-block}

Hi! I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronunced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. 
I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the [Spoken Language Processing group](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/research_groups/speech_processing/index.html){target='_blank'} led by [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/kirby_james/index.html){target='_blank'} at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html){target="_blank"}.

My work combines corpus and experimental methods to untangle the many different ways categorical differences between speech sounds (especially consonants) can be realized phonetically, and what this means for the structure of language.
This work involves working with both well-described Nordic languages and under-resourced languages of [south-east Asia](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/kirby24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'} and [Australia](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/jepson24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'}. I also work on developing general-purpose tools and pipelines for [processing](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/getVOT){target='_blank'}, [analyzing](https://github.com/kirbyj/praatsauce/tree/new-version){target='_blank'}, and [visualizing](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/praatpicture_manual/){target='_blank'} speech data. 

I hold a PhD in phonology and phonetics from Leiden University. [My dissertation](https://www.lotpublications.nl/stop-hey-whats-that-sound){target='_blank'} deals the class of consonant sounds in Danish known as stops: how they are [phonetically](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2022.101191){target='_blank'} [realized](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6449/){target='_blank'}, how they are [structured in the grammar of the language](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2021.2022866){target="_blank"}, and how they [vary among speakers of different dialects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447024000603){target='_blank'}.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

* [Camilla Søballe Horslund](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/camillashm){target='_blank'}, [Henrik Jørgensen](https://www.au.dk/en/norhj@cc.au.dk){target='_blank'} and I published a paper in the Danish journal *Danske Studier* that critically compares the modern Danish-language textbooks in phonetics. The paper can be found [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_danskestudier.pdf){target='_blank'}.

* I will be at the sixth [Phonetics and Phonology in Europe](https://agenda.uib.es/120122/section/52273/6th-phonetics-and-phonology-in-europe-pape-2025.html){target='_blank'} conference in Mallorca in June, where I'll present co-authored work with [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~jkirby/){target='_blank'} and [Nicolai Pharao](https://nors.ku.dk/ansatte/?pure=da/persons/164799){target='_blank'} on the interaction between co-intrinsic *F*~0~ caused by the laryngeal contrast in stops and other prosodic demands on pitch level in Danish. 

* I will be at the third [International Conference on Tone and Intonation](https://www.tai2025.org/){target='_blank'} in Herrsching in May to present co-authored work with [Nicolai Pharao](https://nors.ku.dk/ansatte/?pure=da/persons/164799){target='_blank'} about what appears to be a specialized pitch accent used by some speakers of Danish for contrastive emphasis. See you there!

* I was just at the tenth [Phonology in the Nordic Countries](https://fonologiinorden.wordpress.com/){target='_blank'} meeting in Oslo. I presented work on the acoustics of secondary diphthongs in Danish and the possible emergence of a new one. This work was done in collaboration with [Aleese Block](https://sites.google.com/view/aleeseblock/home){target='_blank'} (who did the lion's share of the work but unfortunately couldn't go) and [Francesco Burroni](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/francescoburroni/home){target='_blank'}. You can see the slides [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_fino.pdf){target='_blank'}.

* I have a paper out in *Diachronica* in collaboration with [Henrik Jørgensen](https://www.au.dk/en/norhj@cc.au.dk){target='_blank'} and [Camilla Søballe Horslund](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/camillashm){target='_blank'} which presents a diachronic perspective on the Danish stop--semivowel alternations couched in Evolutionary Phonology.
