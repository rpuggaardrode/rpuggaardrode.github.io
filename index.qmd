:::{#about-block}

Hi! I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronunced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Spoken Language Processing group led by [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/kirby_james/index.html){target='_blank'} at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html){target="_blank"}, where I'm working on a variety of topics, including microprosodic cues to obstruent voicing contrasts, microprosodic cues to laryngeal coda consonants, the articulatory dynamics of Danish consonants, and the development of software tools for processing and visualizing acoustic data. 

Most of my work (including [my dissertation](https://www.lotpublications.nl/stop-hey-whats-that-sound)) has dealt with the stop consonants of Danish. Colleagues and I have investigated [intervocalic voicing](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6449/){target="_blank"} and [spectral characteristics of stop releases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2022.101191){target="_blank"}, and used a large [legacy corpus of dialect recordings](https://dansklyd.statsbiblioteket.dk/samling/dialektsamlingen/){target="_blank"} to investigate regional variation in [voice onset time](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/JHN1Q7){target="_blank"}, closure voicing, and [characteristics of stop releases](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/icphs2023/){target='_blank'}. We have also proposed a new phonological analysis of the [infamous Danish stop-semivowel alternations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2021.2022866){target="_blank"}, suggesting that they are better understood as the outcome of sound change rather than synchronically active phonology.

I have also published on [information structure from an interactional linguistics perspective](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0332586519000088){target="_blank"}, [forensic phonetics](https://www.nys.dk/article/view/100580){target="_blank"}, [second language acquisition](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/isoctal-preprint.pdf){target="_blank"}, and [morphological change](https://doi.org/10.7146/sss.v11i2.123476){target="_blank"}.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

* My recent article in *Journal of Phonetics* has been selected for the 2023 Best Early Career Scholar's Article of the Year award. I am very honored, grateful, and proud about this! You can read the paper [here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/hisphoncog/){target='_blank'}.

* I have just been to Denmark for two back-to-back meetings. I helped organize the biannual *Phonetics and Phonology in Denmark*, and gave a workshop introducing [`praatpicture`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture){target='_blank'}, my R package for plotting acoustic data with time-aligned annotations. I got some nice feedback and have added some [new functions](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture/blob/main/NEWS.md){target='_blank'} to the latest version of the package. I also went to the biannual Danish linguistics meeting [Møde om udforskningen af dansk sprog](https://projekter.au.dk/muds/){target='_blank'}, where I presented ongoing work on the articulation and acoustics of the Danish semivowel known as the 'soft d'. This work is done in collaboration with [Francesco Burroni](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/francescoburroni/home){target='_blank'} and [Aleese Block](https://sites.google.com/view/aleeseblock){target='_blank'}.

* I was just in Tartu for the [International Symposium on Applied Phonetics](https://sisu.ut.ee/isaph2024/){target='_blank'} where I presented co-authored work with [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'} about the acoustic properties of Dhuwaya stops, and how they might be used to improve literacy teaching. You can read the proceedings paper [here](https://doi.org/10.21437/ISAPh.2024-14){target='_blank'}. Thanks for all the stimulating conversations!

* A paper of mine has been published in [*Journal of Phonetics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447024000603){target='_blank'}. This paper demonstrates that variability in coda stop lenition in Jutland Danish is predictable from how the laryngeal contrast is precisely realized in onset stops. [Here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/hisphoncog/){target='_blank'} you can find a version of the paper with embedded analysis code, and [here](https://osf.io/hynqx/){target='_blank'} you can download the data and code.

* I've contributed to work that will be presented at two conferences in Australia later this year. [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'}, [John Mansfield](https://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en/mansfield.html){target='_blank'} and I had a paper accepted for the conference of the [Australian Linguistic Society](https://als.asn.au/Conference/2024/General){target='_blank'} in Canberra in November about stylized sustained prosody in narrative speech in native Australian languages, and [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'} and I had a paper accepted for the [19th Australasian International Conference on Speech Science and Technology](https://assta.org/sst-2024/){target='_blank'} in Melbourne in December about what governs vowel duration in Djambarrpuyŋu in phonological contexts where it is not contrastive.
