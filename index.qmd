:::{#about-block}

Hi! I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronunced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. 
I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the [Spoken Language Processing group](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/research_groups/speech_processing/index.html){target='_blank'} led by [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/kirby_james/index.html){target='_blank'} at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html){target="_blank"}.

My work combines corpus and experimental methods to untangle the many different ways categorical differences between speech sounds (especially consonants) can be realized phonetically, and what this means for the structure of language.
This work involves working with both well-described Nordic languages and under-resourced languages of [south-east Asia](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/kirby24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'} and [Australia](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/jepson24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'}. I also work on developing general-purpose tools and pipelines for [processing](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/getVOT){target='_blank'}, [analyzing](https://github.com/kirbyj/praatsauce/tree/new-version){target='_blank'}, and [visualizing](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/praatpicture_manual/){target='_blank'} speech data. 

I hold a PhD in phonology and phonetics from Leiden University. [My dissertation](https://www.lotpublications.nl/stop-hey-whats-that-sound){target='_blank'} deals the class of consonant sounds in Danish known as stops: how they are [phonetically](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2022.101191){target='_blank'} [realized](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6449/){target='_blank'}, how they are [structured in the grammar of the language](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2021.2022866){target="_blank"}, and how they [vary among speakers of different dialects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447024000603){target='_blank'}.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

* I was just at the tenth [Phonology in the Nordic Countries](https://fonologiinorden.wordpress.com/){target='_blank'} meeting in Oslo. I presented work on the acoustics of secondary diphthongs in Danish and the possible emergence of a new one. This work was done in collaboration with [Aleese Block](https://sites.google.com/view/aleeseblock/home){target='_blank'} (who did the lion's share of the work but unfortunately couldn't go) and [Francesco Burroni](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/francescoburroni/home){target='_blank'}. You can see the slides [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_fino.pdf){target='_blank'}.

* I have a paper out in *Diachronica* in collaboration with [Henrik Jørgensen](https://www.au.dk/en/norhj@cc.au.dk){target='_blank'} and [Camilla Søballe Horslund](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/camillashm){target='_blank'} which presents a diachronic perspective on the Danish stop--semivowel alternations couched in Evolutionary Phonology. You can read the paper [here](https://benjamins.com/catalog/dia.23068.pug){target='_blank'}.

* I am the recipient of a Carlsberg Foundation Reintegration Fellowship for the project [Category-shifting Change in Real Time](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en/what-we-have-funded/cf24-1380/){target='_blank'}, where I'll be investigating how small incremental sound changes can cause major structural change using a large longitudinal speech corpus. This work will be based at the [Centre for Language Change in Real Time](https://lanchart.hum.ku.dk/){target='_blank'} in Copenhagen.

* I have a paper out (in Danish) in the most recent issue of *Nydanske Sprogstudier* about phonetic annotation of stops, which has in recent years been debated extensively in the Danish phonetics community. You can read the paper [here](https://www.nys.dk/article/view/145000){target='_blank'}, there's an English abstract [here](https://www.nys.dk/article/view/150505){target='_blank'}. The paper is partially based on a typological study of annotation practice which you can see [here](https://osf.io/pe8cn/){target='_blank'}.

* I've contributed to work that was presented by [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'} at two conferences in Australia recently: a coauthored paper with [John Mansfield](https://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en/mansfield.html){target='_blank'} about stylized sustained prosody in narrative speech in native Australian languages at the conference of the [Australian Linguistic Society](https://als.asn.au/Conference/2024/General){target='_blank'} in Canberra, and a paper about what governs vowel duration in Djambarrpuyŋu in phonological contexts where it is not contrastive at the [19th Australasian International Conference on Speech Science and Technology](https://assta.org/sst-2024/){target='_blank'} in Melbourne. You can read more about the former study [here](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/jepson24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'}, and about the latter study [here](https://assta.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/No_29_Jepson_Puggaard-Rode_2024_142_146.pdf){target='_blank'}.
