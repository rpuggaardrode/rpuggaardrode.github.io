:::{#about-block}

Hi! I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronunced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Spoken Language Processing group led by [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/kirby_james/index.html){target='_blank'} at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html){target="_blank"}, where I'm working on a variety of topics, including microprosodic cues to obstruent voicing contrasts, microprosodic cues to laryngeal coda consonants, the articulatory dynamics of Danish consonants, and the development of software tools for processing and visualizing acoustic data. 

Most of my work (including [my dissertation](https://www.lotpublications.nl/stop-hey-whats-that-sound)) has dealt with the stop consonants of Danish. Colleagues and I have investigated [intervocalic voicing](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6449/){target="_blank"} and [spectral characteristics of stop releases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2022.101191){target="_blank"}, and used a large [legacy corpus of dialect recordings](https://dansklyd.statsbiblioteket.dk/samling/dialektsamlingen/){target="_blank"} to investigate regional variation in [voice onset time](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/JHN1Q7){target="_blank"}, closure voicing, and [characteristics of stop releases](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/icphs2023/){target='_blank'}. We have also proposed a new phonological analysis of the [infamous Danish stop-semivowel alternations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2021.2022866){target="_blank"}, suggesting that they are better understood as the outcome of sound change rather than synchronically active phonology.

I have also published on [information structure from an interactional linguistics perspective](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0332586519000088){target="_blank"}, [forensic phonetics](https://www.nys.dk/article/view/100580){target="_blank"}, [second language acquisition](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/isoctal-preprint.pdf){target="_blank"}, and [morphological change](https://doi.org/10.7146/sss.v11i2.123476){target="_blank"}.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

* A paper of mine has been published in [*Journal of Phonetics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447024000603){target='_blank'}. This paper demonstrates that variability in coda stop lenition in Jutland Danish is predictable from how the laryngeal contrast is precisely realized in onset stops. [Here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/hisphoncog/){target='_blank'} you can find a version of the paper with embedded analysis code, and [here](https://osf.io/hynqx/){target='_blank'} you can download the data and code.

* I've contributed to work that will be presented at two conferences in Australia later this year. [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'}, [John Mansfield](https://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en/mansfield.html){target='_blank'} and I had a paper accepted for the conference of the [Australian Linguistic Society](https://als.asn.au/Conference/2024/General){target='_blank'} in Canberra in November about stylized sustained prosody in narrative speech in native Australian languages, and [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'} and I had a paper accepted for the [19th Australasian International Conference on Speech Science and Technology](https://assta.org/sst-2024/){target='_blank'} in Melbourne in December about what governs vowel duration in Djambarrpuyŋu in phonological contexts where it is not contrastive.

* I was at [Speech Prosody](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/sp2024){target='_blank'} in Leiden, where I presented a paper on stylized sustained pitch in narrative speech in native Australian languages, coauthored with [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'} and [John Mansfield](https://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/en/mansfield.html){target='_blank'}; slides are [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_speech-prosody_ssp.pdf){target='_blank'}, and the full paper is available [here](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/jepson24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'}. I also coauthored a paper on coda pitch perturbations in Eastern Khmu' with [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/kirby_james/index.html){target='_blank'}, [Francesco Burroni](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/francescoburroni/home){target='_blank'}, and [Sireemas Maspong](https://sireemasm.github.io/){target='_blank'} (full paper [here](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/kirby24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'}), which was part of a [special session on segmental influences on prosody](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/sp2024/program/special-sessions#organizers-menghui-shi-and-rasmus-puggaard-rode){target='_blank'} that I co-organized with [Menghui Shi](https://imoll.fudan.edu.cn/info/1088/1092.htm){target='_blank'}. It was a very stimulating conference, and it was great to be back at my alma mater!

* I was at the [13th International Seminar on Speech Production](https://issp24.sciencesconf.org/){target='_blank'} in Autrans. I saw a lot of inspiring talks, enjoyed the alps, and got to spread the word about [`praatpicture`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatpicture){target='_blank'}, my R package for plotting acoustic data with time-aligned annotations. You can find my abstract [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/2024_issp.pdf){target='_blank'}, a proceedings paper is available [here](https://www.isca-archive.org/issp_2024/puggaardrode24_issp.html){target='_blank'}, and my poster is available [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024_issp_poster.pdf){target='_blank'}. 

* I'm heading to Tartu in September for the [International Symposium on Applied Phonetics](https://sisu.ut.ee/isaph2024/){target='_blank'} where I'll be presenting co-authored work with [Kathleen Jepson](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/people/visitors1/jepson_kathleen/index.html){target='_blank'} about the acoustic properties of Dhuwaya stops, and how they might be used to improve literacy teaching. See you there!
