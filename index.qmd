:::{#about-block}

Hi! I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronounced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. 
I am Associate Professor of Phonetics at the University of Oxford, based at the [phonetics lab](https://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/){target='_blank'}, and an Official Fellow of [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/){target='_blank'}. 

My work combines corpus and experimental methods to untangle the many different ways categorical differences between speech sounds (especially consonants) can be realized phonetically, and what this means for the structure of language.
This work involves working with both well-described Nordic languages and under-resourced languages of [south-east Asia](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/kirby24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'} and [Australia](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/jepson24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'}. I also work on developing general-purpose tools and pipelines for [processing](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/getVOT){target='_blank'}, [analyzing](https://github.com/kirbyj/praatsauce/tree/new-version){target='_blank'}, and [visualizing](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/praatpicture_manual/){target='_blank'} speech data. 

I hold a PhD in phonology and phonetics from Leiden University. [My dissertation](https://www.lotpublications.nl/stop-hey-whats-that-sound){target='_blank'} deals the class of consonant sounds in Danish known as stops: how they are [phonetically](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2022.101191){target='_blank'} [realized](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6449/){target='_blank'}, how they are [structured in the grammar of the language](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2021.2022866){target="_blank"}, and how they [vary among speakers of different dialects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447024000603){target='_blank'}. Before coming to Oxford, I was a postdoc in the [Spoken Language Processing group](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/research_groups/speech_processing/index.html){target='_blank'} at the [Institute for Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html){target="_blank"}.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

* I have moved to Oxford where I have taken up the post of Associate Professor of Phonetics, joining the vibrant [Faculty of Linguistics, Philology, and Phonetics](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/){target='_blank'} and the [Phonetics Lab](https://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/){target='_blank'}. My first task here is to assist in moving the lab from its previous location on Wellington Sq to the new [Schwarzman Centre for the Humanities](https://schwarzmancentre.humanities.ox.ac.uk/){target='_blank'}.

* At the recent [Interspeech](https://www.interspeech2025.org/home){target='_blank'}, [Michaela Watkins](https://sites.google.com/view/michaelawatkins/home){target='_blank'} presented collaborative work with [Paul Boersma](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/){target='_blank'}, [Silke Hamann](https://fon.hum.uva.nl/silke/){target='_blank'} and myself on using [F0 ratio](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/watkins24_interspeech.html){target='_blank'} as a diagnostic for the presence of creaky voice using data from Seoul Korean and Modern Standard Danish. You can find the paper [here](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2025/watkins25_interspeech.html){target='_blank'}.

* I was just at the (very hot) sixth [Phonetics and Phonology in Europe](https://agenda.uib.es/120122/section/52273/6th-phonetics-and-phonology-in-europe-pape-2025.html){target='_blank'} conference in Palma, where I presented co-authored work with [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~jkirby/){target='_blank'} and [Nicolai Pharao](https://nors.ku.dk/ansatte/?pure=da/persons/164799){target='_blank'} on the interaction between co-intrinsic *F*~0~ caused by the laryngeal contrast in stops and other prosodic demands on pitch level in Danish. You can find the poster [here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/cf0dan/pape){target='_blank'}.

* I've started developing an R library called [`praatutils`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/praatutils){target='_blank'} for calling the signal processing tools in [Praat](https://fon.hum.uva.nl/praat){target='_blank'} directly from R and getting results back in R-readable format. The project is in its early stages and feedback and contributions are very welcome!

* Our group in Munich hosted the third [International Conference on Tone and Intonation](https://www.tai2025.org/){target='_blank'} in Herrsching. In addition to having great conversations and running around with a microphone during Q&A's, I also presented a poster with [Nicolai Pharao](https://nors.ku.dk/ansatte/?pure=da/persons/164799){target='_blank'} about what appears to be a specialized pitch accent used by some speakers of Danish for contrastive emphasis. Materials can be found [here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/tai){target='_blank'}.

* [Katie Jepson](https://languages-cultures.uq.edu.au/profile/10666/kathleen-jepson){target='_blank'}, [John Mansfield](http://langwidj.org/wp/){target='_blank'} and I are organizing a special session on the  [stylized sustained prosody](https://www.isca-archive.org/speechprosody_2024/jepson24_speechprosody.html){target='_blank'} pattern found in the narrative register of many native Australian languages. It's at this year's [Australian Linguistic Society](https://als.asn.au/Conference/2025/General){target='_blank'} meeting at the Gold Coast campus of Griffith University in December. Please get in touch if you're interested in contributing!
