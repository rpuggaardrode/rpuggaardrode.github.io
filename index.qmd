:::{#about-block}

Hi! I’m Rasmus Puggaard-Rode, roughly pronunced [ˈʁɑsmus ˌpʰukːɒːˀˈʁoːɤ]. I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Spoken Language Processing group led by [James Kirby](https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/kirby_james/index.html){target='_blank'} at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing, Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html){target="_blank"}, where I'm mainly working on microprosodic cues to obstruent voicing contrasts in various languages including Danish. I also work on developing open-source tools and pipelines for automatic acoustic analysis, such as the [`getVOT`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/getVOT){target="_blank"} R package for automatic annotation of voice onset time landmarks.

Most of my work (including [my dissertation](https://www.lotpublications.nl/stop-hey-whats-that-sound)) has dealt with the stop consonants of Danish. Colleagues and I have investigated [intervocalic voicing](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6449/){target="_blank"} and [spectral characteristics of stop releases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2022.101191){target="_blank"}, and used a large [legacy corpus of dialect recordings](https://dansklyd.statsbiblioteket.dk/samling/dialektsamlingen/){target="_blank"} to investigate regional variation in [voice onset time](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/JHN1Q7){target="_blank"}, closure voicing, and [characteristics of stop releases](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/icphs2023/){target='_blank'}. We have also proposed a new phonological analysis of the [infamous Danish stop-semivowel alternations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2021.2022866){target="_blank"}, suggesting that they are better understood as the outcome of sound change rather than synchronically active phonology.

I have also published on [information structure from an interactional linguistics perspective](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0332586519000088){target="_blank"}, [forensic phonetics](https://www.nys.dk/article/view/100580){target="_blank"}, [second language acquisition](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/isoctal-preprint.pdf){target="_blank"}, and [morphological change](https://doi.org/10.7146/sss.v11i2.123476){target="_blank"}.

I'm a passionate teacher, and have experience in teaching phonetics, phonology, statistics, and introductory linguistics.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>Upcoming</h2>

* 7--11 August, 2023: *International Congress of Phonetic Sciences*, Prague Congress Center.

<h2 style='text-align: center;'>News</h2>

* Welcome to my new web page written in Quarto! I'll start using this instead of my previous WordPress page (although I'll keep up a small version of that because GitHub pages aren't easy to find on search engines).

* I co-wrote a paper with Bert Botma and Janet Grijzenhout laying out the principles of a framework of phonological representation we call Q--CV that builds on [Q-Theory](https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/qtheory/){target='_blank'}. We show how this can represent many kinds of laryngeal and timing-based contrasts in stop consonants, and how it can derive positional sonorant devoicing in Danish. You can read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198791126.003.0012){target='_blank'} if you have access -- otherwise feel free to reach out!

* I published a tutorial showing basic usage and the inner workings of my R package [`getVOT`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/getVOT){target="_blank"} on [Linguistics Methods Hub](https://lingmethodshub.github.io/){target='_blank'}. You can read it [here](https://lingmethodshub.github.io/content/R/getVOT-tutorial/){target="_blank"}.

* I published a developmental R package on GitHub, [`getVOT`](https://github.com/rpuggaardrode/getVOT){target="_blank"}, which automates the process of annotating voice onset time. I also gave a presentation in Aarhus on how it works; slides can be found [here](https://rpuggaardrode.github.io/getVOT-pres/#1){target="_blank"}.

* I presented a paper on the relationship between fine phonetic detail and sound change at the third *Hanyang International Symposium of Phonetics and Cognitive Sciences of Language*, focusing on stop phonetics and stop lenition in Jutland Danish. I also gave an earlier version of this presentation at the PhD and Postdoc Kolloquium at the IPS in Munich. Slides can be found [here](https://rasmuspuggaard.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/2023_hisphoncog_slides.pdf){target='_blank'}.
